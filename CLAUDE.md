Code for the paper "Improving Cross-Lingual Factual Recall via Consistency-Driven
Reinforcement Learning" (ACL ARR 2026 May, submission 8689, arXiv 2606.06586).
Compares CPT / SFT / GRPO for cross-lingual factual recall on OLMo-2-1124-7B and
Qwen-2.5-7B, using the PolyFact dataset (100K Wikidata facts × 12 languages).

## Environment

- **AWS Trainium instances (trn1/trn2)**: run `bash setup_trainium.sh` once on a
  fresh instance (idempotent; handles Ubuntu 26.04 / kernel 7.0 quirks including
  a Neuron driver source patch). Then `source ~/neuron_venv/bin/activate`
  (sets `PJRT_DEVICE=NEURON`) and pass `--device xla` to eval scripts.
- Neuron caches **failed** compilations in `/var/tmp/neuron-compile-cache` —
  after fixing a compiler error, delete that directory or the error replays.
- GPU machines: the same scripts run with `--device cuda` (auto-detected).

## Datasets (HF hub, account `jvonrad`)

- `jvonrad/WIKI-FACT` — nested schema: one row per fact, `langs` dict with
  per-language `question` / `options` / `answer_text`. Used by the eval scripts.
- `jvonrad/PolyFact` — same facts, per-language configs (`option_a..d`,
  `answer_index`) plus a `parallel` config. This is the paper-facing release.
- Languages: en, de, id, pt, ar, bn, sw, es, ru, fr, ja, zh. Test split: 2,523
  usable facts. Options are 4 MCQ candidates (1 gold + 3 distractors), same
  entities across languages but **independently shuffled per language, with no
  stored distractor entity ids**.

## Evaluation

- `evaluate/evaluate_accuracy.py` — per-language accuracy only (logprob scoring
  of the 4 options, `--score_mode avg` = length-normalized; prompt is
  `Question: {q}\nAnswer:`). Renamed from `evaluate_consistency.py` because it
  never measured consistency.
- `evaluate/evaluate_crosslingual_consistency.py` — accuracy **plus** the
  consistency metrics reviewers asked for: Total Consistency (correct in ALL 12
  languages + histogram), RankC (Qi et al. EMNLP 2023; softmax-weighted top-j
  overlap per language pair), pairwise answer agreement. Supports
  `--benchmark polyfact` and `--benchmark global_mmlu` (Global-MMLU joins
  languages on `sample_id`, options parallel by index).
- **Always pass `--alignment_cache evaluate/alignments/polyfact_test_alignment.json`
  for PolyFact test.** RankC needs distractors aligned across languages; this
  committed cache (exact match + LaBSE assignment, 0 unaligned) makes numbers
  comparable across model variants. Recomputing it may produce slightly
  different alignments.
- Results JSONs include raw per-option scores, so new metrics can be computed
  from saved output without re-running the model.

## Known inconsistencies to resolve

- The paper appendix says the PolyFact evaluator wraps questions in a
  language-specific instruction prompt; the actual scripts use the plain
  `Question:/Answer:` wrapper. Reconcile before the rebuttal.
- README references `requirements.txt`, which does not exist in the repo.

## Rebuttal work outstanding (from ACL ARR reviews, July 2026)

Done: direct consistency metrics (RankC + total consistency) on PolyFact and
Global-MMLU. Still requested by reviewers: CLC-enhancement baselines (DCO,
EN-pivot DPO / CM-Align, representation intervention), a GRPO ablation without
the all-language consistency bonus, expanded related work (Qi et al. 2023,
Fierro & Søgaard 2022, X-FACTR, Paths Not Taken), training/token cost
reporting, and confidence intervals for the small Global-MMLU deltas.
